						<h2 className='name'>Adam Burgess</h2>
						<p className='summary'>I am a front end software developer and former CPA with six years of experience in public accounting. 
							I recently decided to switch careers and pursue my passion for software development.
							As a front end developer, I thoroughly enjoy creating applications that are accessible, user-friendly 
							and provide for an overall positive user experience. What excites me the most about software development 
							is the unlimited possibilities. Nearly all of our daily tasks involve some sort of interaction with code. 
							Being able to be a part of that user interaction now and in the future is very inspiring to me.</p>

						<h2 className='name'>Carly Collums</h2>
						<p className='summary'>I am a positive, and compassionate software developer driven by an imaginative thinking style and growth mindset.
						I obtained my Bachelors degree in Business Marketing with minors in Drawing and Literature. Upon graduating I began 
						working for an IT recruiting company and was exposed to the vast world of tech in a way that I had not been before. 
						This opened my eyes to the world of software development and I was immediately smitten. I am drawn to problem solving, 
						continuous learning, and the creativity that software development offers.</p>

						<h2 className='name'>Kyra Bergsund</h2>
						<p className='summary'>I am a detail-oriented software engineer with a proven track record of end-to-end project management experience in the 
							entertainment industry. I started my career in event production because I am passionate about facilitating meaningful experiences 
							for broad audiences. I love being part of a team that fabricates joy. Now, as a software engineer, I continue that work by actively 
							contributing to the creation of impactful products. Iâ€™m focused on the intersections of impactful, immersive tech, human connection, 
							and sustainability. Specializing in front-end engineering with experience in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS/Sass, I bring my eagerness to 
							never stop learning, my enjoyment of solving problems in innovative ways, and my strengths in methodical organization and proactive 
							communication to every team. As an outdoor enthusiast, I am excited by the potential for software products to bring people together 
							and to increase access to outdoor education, recreation, and sustainable living. I believe it is an avenue that will in turn inspire 
							people to care more for each other and the world we live in.</p>
