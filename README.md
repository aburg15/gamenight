## Introduction 

Gamenight was born out of a love for, well, game nights. We were motivated by a shared desire for a simple interface that keeps track of the competition, friendly or not, among friends across multiple game nights. Part time capsule, part scoreboard, gamenight is for anyone who enjoys getting together with loved ones to battle it out for bragging rights. 

Gamenight was completed as part of Turing School of Software & Designsâ€™ intensive Front-End Engineering program. The goal was to envision and build a complex React web app from scratch while  self-teaching a new concept, global state management using React's Context API, in the span of one week.

## Wins And Challenges 

### Wins

- Our biggest win and takeaway was self teaching a new concept in a matter of days: Global State Management using Context API 
- Teamwork and communication: we established a really great team dynamic, remembering that we are all humans first. This led to a really positive and productive work environement
- Fully designing and developing an application of our own concept

### Challenges 

- We wanted to implement a hamburger button for a more responsive design, which proved to be more challenging in React than initially anticipated 
- Using localStorage along with Context API and React Hooks took a bit of self-teaching compared to using localStorage with Vanilla JS
  
## Future Improvements
Now that our MVP functionality has been built out, there is still so much we would love to add in the future! 

- Add functionality to clear individual gamenights (in case of user error, creating an incorrect gamenight) 
- Add ability to delete indivdual game plays (once again to account for user error)
- Access more than the top 25 board games, so that users can choose from more games
- Allow users to add their own option for a game to be played on a game night 
- Add the ability to click on a game on the games page and be shown more details about that specific game
